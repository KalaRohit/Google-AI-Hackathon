# Introduction

**SimpleScript is a One-click Google Chrome extension that simplifies webpage text to your reading level, powered by generative AI.**

# Background

According to recent statistics, 54% of the US population reads below a 6th-grade level [[1]](#1). This implies that over half of the population might find it challenging to read and understand an average Wikipedia page, which typically has a 14th-grade reading level [[2]](#2). This issue may be even worse in less literate countries.

The internet, at the literacy level, is not fully accessible to the general public. Fortunately, state-of-the-art generative AI technology excels at summarizing and rewriting text, inspiring us to use this technology to make webpages understandable to everyone, effortlessly.

# Project Goal

Our goal is to leverage the content-curating capabilities of generative AI to help users effortlessly understand most web content. We also aim to offer different reading levels allowing users to select the literacy level they are most comfortable with to adjust the web content.

Additionally, we provide a chat function that lets users interact with the generative AI in the context of the entire webpage. For example, they can request summaries, ask questions about specific sections, and more.

# Future Work

To enhance functionality and user experience, we have several future developments planned for SimpleScript:

- **Document Integration**: We'll enable SimpleScript to not only simplify webpages but also documents like PDFs or Word files.
- **Speed Improvements**: Continuous code optimization will make SimpleScript faster and more efficient.
- **Pre-set Chat Prompts**: We'll add commonly used prompts like 'Summarize this page for me,' reducing the need for manual typing.
- **Responsive Design**: We aim to create a flexible design for SimpleScript, allowing users to adjust its size and position to fit their screen and website layout.
