# Introduction

**SimpleScript is a One-click Google Chrome extension that simplifies webpage text to your reading level, powered by generative AI.**

# Background

According to recent statistics, 54% of the US population reads below a 6th-grade level [[1]](#1), making standard sources like Wikipedia, which typically have a 14th-grade reading level [[2]](#2), inaccessible to over half of the population. This issue may be even worse in less literate countries.

The internet, at the content level, is not fully accessible to the general public. Fortunately, state-of-the-art generative AI technology excels at summarizing and rewriting text, inspiring us to use this technology to make webpages understandable to everyone, effortlessly.

# Project Goal

Our goal is to leverage the content-curating capabilities of generative AI to help users effortlessly understand most web content. We also aim to offer different reading levels, allowing users to select the literacy level they are most comfortable with when using AI to adjust web content.

Additionally, we provide a chat function that lets users interact with the generative AI in the context of the entire webpage. For example, they can request summaries, ask questions about specific sections, and more.
